# MonasteryNetwork

## Description

This repository contains an the final exercise of the “Sociology of Social Networks” course at the École Normale Supérieure and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. This is a social network analysis with R where I applied several statistical methods to analyze the structure of a complete social network of monks from a monastery.

## Abstract

The doctoral thesis of Samuel F. Sampson describes a monastery with opposing progressive and conservative factions of novices. This exercise uses the network compiled by Sampson, regarding likeness and dislikeness relations, to explore the correlation between the cohesion of the factions and their centrality. The comparison suggests that the primary factions in the debate present the highest in-degree centrality but average results in other areas, whereas the smaller factions show low centrality but high cohesiveness. Finally, despite having low cohesiveness, the high centrality of the Interstitial group implies a privileged position in the exchanges between the main factions of the monastery.
